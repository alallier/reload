2.0.0 / 2017-02-17

Removed Express as a dependency
Watching files is more intuitive and actually included outside of CLI
Better verbose logging where outside library can mandate how logging occurs
Added EADDRINUSE to cli-prompt where if port is in use, another port can be supplied to start server on another open port
Made more functional for all types of servers and not just an express server
reload package auto appends client script to all html requests
