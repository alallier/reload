2.2.2 / 2017-08-20
------------------

Fixed bug that caused HTML files to not be served when using directory flag (reload command line). See: https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/139

2.2.0 / 2017-07-27
------------------

* Dropped express as a dependency (in reload command line). Reload now uses a vanilla node http server to achieve the same result. This update for the command line offers no changes to the end user and simply modifies the underlying code. See: https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/132

2.1.0 / 2017-07-25

2.0.0 / 2017-07-09
------------------

See V2.0.0 PR https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/118

### Added
* Added object based parameters (Issue [#77](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/77) / Originally solved in PR [#101](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/101) and refactored in [#104](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/104))
* Added port configuration (Issue [#60](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/60) / Originally solved in PR [#68](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/68) and refactored in [#104](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/104))
* Added timestamp to reload command line reloading (Issue [#7](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/7) / PR [#78](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/78))
* Added node 8 support (Issue [#106](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/106) / PR [#119](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/119))
* Added table of contents to README (Issue [#103](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/103) / PR [#105](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/105))
* Added return API to README (PR [#121](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/121))

### Modified
* Abstracted reload call to an index.js file. Index file now calls `reload.js` source file. This is to abstract the reload command line calling with a third argument that is now private and not apart of the public API (PR [#117](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/117))
* Update dependencies to latest and add package-lock.json files (PR [#109](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/109))
* Audited and refactored return API (Issue [#120](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/120) / PR [#121](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/121))

### Removed
* Drop support for server and just use ports (Issue [#102](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/102) / PR [#104](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/104))
* Removed support of node 0.1 and 0.12 (Issue [#73](https://github.com/alallier/reload/issues/73) / PR [#86](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/86))
* Separate server and app initialization into two parts. (This was originally fixed in PR [#71](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/71) but was reversed in PR [#104](https://github.com/alallier/reload/pull/104) when the decision to drop server was made.)

### API Breaking Changes
This version makes breaking changes to the reload API. The only required argument to reload now is `app`. This makes reload a lot [easier](https://github.com/jprichardson/reload/pull/104) to use. Reload takes a maximum of two arguments `app` and an `opts` (options) object with the following optional parameters, `port`, `route`, and `verbose`. Reload runs on default port `9856` unless otherwise specified in the `opts` object.

#### How to upgrade from Version 1 to Version 2
Before Version 2 reload always attached to your server's port by passing the server in a argument to reload. We have now dropped support for server and reload runs on ports only. Reload now has one required parameter `app` and one optional parameter `opts` an object of reload options. Below are two upgrade examples for the only two possible 1.x configurations.

Upgrade with required arguments: `reload(server, app)` becomes `reload(app)`

Upgrade with both required arguments and the one optional argument: `reload(server, app, true)` becomes `reload(app, {verbose: true})`

It is important to note that reload **only** uses ports now. So upgrading using the examples above will have reload run on it's default port `9856`. If you want to run reload on a different port you need to specify a port in the `opts` object like: `reload(app, {port: 9852})`

Most people can just use the default settings, allowing `reload(app)` to work in most cases.

Please refer to the full API in the [README](README.md#api-for-express).
